### Github Bot

A tutorial by [Mariatta](https://github.com/Mariatta/github-bot-tutorial) during
[Pycon Cleveland 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvjtCjimiw&feature=youtu.be)

We start off by learning to use the [gidgethub](https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) library, by [Brett Cannon](https://github.com/brettcannon/gidgethub), for calling GitHub's API

Next we'll use these methods to write applications that run automation on
GitHub, using GitHub WebHooks and APIs.
The application will be hosted from within a Heroku account.
